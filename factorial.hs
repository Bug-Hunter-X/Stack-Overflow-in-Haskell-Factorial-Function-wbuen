This Haskell code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion, but contains a subtle error related to pattern matching and base case handling. 

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

The error arises when a negative number is passed as input. The recursion will continue indefinitely, resulting in a stack overflow error.  The issue stems from the lack of a proper base case for negative inputs.
